# Flights_on_CoreData
This is Stanford swiftui project showing USA flights list with ability to filter by airport, airline, flight and onair. Flights data is supposed to be fethed from the internet service. However simple seed simulation is also supported. There are lot of comments to help my self and maybe others to follow up. MVVM pattern , Web reuqest and CoreData are used.
The next thing about UIKit integration is coming up
